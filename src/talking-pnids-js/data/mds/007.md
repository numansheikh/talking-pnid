**System Overview and Visualization**

Imagine standing in front of a large industrial piping assembly. The centerpiece is the **Scraper Receiver**, a heavy pressure vessel designed to receive pipeline cleaning tools (pigs). The system consists of a massive 20-inch main pipeline, the receiver vessel itself, and a complex network of smaller bypass, drain, and vent lines managing pressure and fluid flow.

**1\. Equipment Specifications: The Scraper Receiver**

* **Tag:** PP01361 P1 (also referred to as 361 V01).  
* **Dimensions:** The vessel has a **Major Barrel** with a 610 mm Internal Diameter (ID) for handling the pig, and a **Minor Barrel** with a 508 mm ID connected to the pipeline.  
* **Material:** Constructed from Carbon Steel with a 3 mm internal corrosion alloy lining.  
* **Conditions:**  
  * **Design:** Rated for 45 barg pressure with a temperature range of \-29°C to \+100°C.  
  * **Operating:** Runs between 10 to 11 barg at 20°C to 80°C.  
* **Insulation:** The vessel is uninsulated.  
* **Trim Number:** PB01 361 B0 TX B 03 E7.

 

**2\. The Main Incoming Pipeline (20-Inch Line)**

Everything begins with the main product flow arriving from the **New PCB Station**.

* **Line:** This is a **20-inch line** (Tag: PP01 361 GF01 P 03 F9).  
* **Instrumentation:** Immediately upon entering the diagram, the flow passes flow instrumentation:  
  * **FI-01 / FY-01** (Flow Indicator and Relay).  
* **Corrosion Injection:** Downstream of the flow meter, there is a **2-inch injection point** connecting to the **Corrosion Inhibitor Injection Package** (PB01 520 Z101). The line includes a specific valve arrangement (CP01, CC01, CI01) and connects via pump NPG PP01.  
* **Branching:** This main 20-inch line continues past the receiver. However, to divert the pig into the receiver, flow is manipulated via the **Kicker Line** (Nozzle N1).

 

**3\. The Kicker Line (Nozzle N1)**

This system diverts fluid to push the pig into the receiver. It taps off the main 20-inch line and enters the vessel at **Nozzle N1**.

* **Line Size:** 8-inch (Tag: PP01 361 GF 03 B 03 E7).  
* **Valve Arrangement (Double Block and Bleed):**  
  * The line passes through an **8-inch Ball Valve (HV-02)**.  
  * It continues through a second **8-inch Ball Valve (HV-01)**.  
  * **Safety Bleed:** Sandwiched between HV-02 and HV-01 is a **1-inch Drain Ball Valve (HV-03)** used to depressurize the space between the valves.  
* **Bypass Loop:** Parallel to this main kicker route, there is a smaller bypass for fine control:  
  * It features a **2-inch Globe Valve (HV-05)** and a **2-inch Ball Valve (HV-04)**.  
  * *Piping Spec Change:* Before the Globe valve, the spec is **B 03 E7**; after the Globe valve, it changes to **B 03 F9**.  
* **Alternate Path (N11):** There is also a **4-inch branch** (Tag: GF05 B 03 E7) originating before HV-02. It passes through a **4-inch Valve (HV-10)** and connects to **Nozzle N11** (the receiving side of the barrel).

 

**4\. Venting, Equalization, and Relief Systems (N2, N7, N4)**

To safely operate the receiver door, pressure must be managed via top-mounted nozzles.

* **Nozzle N2 & N7 (Balance Line):**  
  * **Nozzle N2** serves as the moving/pressurization side. It is a **2-inch line** equipped with a **2-inch Ball Valve (HV-36)**.  
  * **Nozzle N7** connects directly to the N2 line. The N7 line (Tag: GF0010) includes a **2-inch Ball Valve (HV-11)**.  
  * These lines merge. After the merge, the line flows through **HV-06 (Ball Valve)** and **HV-07 (Globe Valve)**.  
  * **Control Valve:** Branching off HV-07 is a control valve **F401**. Here, the piping spec changes from **B 03 E7** to **B 01 B8** (Tag: PP01 502...). This line vents to a Safe Location (SPN01).  
* **Nozzle N4 (Safety Relief):**  
  * This is a **3-inch line** (GF0008) fitted with a blind flange initially.  
  * It reduces from 3-inch to 1-inch to feed the **Pressure Safety Valve (PSV-01)**.  
  * **PSV Details:** Set pressure 45 barg, Size 1E2, Fireproof case.  
  * **Discharge:** After the PSV, the line expands via a reducer (2" to 4") and vents to a safe location. This discharge line includes a **0.5-inch Drain Valve (HV-1)**.

 

**5\. Vessel Instrumentation (N3, N5 & Body)**

* **Nozzle N3:** Fitted with a **2-inch Solenoid Valve (HV-08)** and a Pressure Gauge connection (**PG-02**).  
* **Nozzle N5:** Fitted with a **2-inch Solenoid Valve (HV-09)** and a Pressure Gauge connection (**PG-01**).  
* **Pig Signaler:** Mounted directly on the vessel is **Z-02 / HZI-2**, which signals when a pig has arrived in the barrel.

 

**6\. The Drain System (Nozzles N10 & N12)**

Located at the bottom of the vessel to drain liquids into the closed drain system.

* **Configuration:**  
  * **Nozzle N10:** 4-inch outlet with a Gate Valve. Spec changes from B 03 E7 to B 03 E8.  
  * **Nozzle N12:** 4-inch outlet with a Gate Valve. Spec changes similarly.  
  * These two lines (DK01 and DK02) merge into a common header.  
* **Drain Header:**  
  * The combined line passes through a **4-inch Gate Valve (HV-13)**.  
  * *Spec Change:* After HV-13, the pipe spec changes to **B 01 M8** (Tag: DK03).  
  * There is a **0.5-inch drain point (HV-09)** located near the main drain valves.  
  * **Termination:** The line expands via a reducer (4" to 8") and routes to the **Closed Drain System (2D DC1)**.

 

**7\. Main Outlet and Re-injection (Nozzle N9)**

This is where the pig is retrieved, and the flow reconnects to the main line.

* **Nozzle N9:** The main barrel outlet.  
* **Isolation:**  
  * First, a **20-inch Ball Valve (HV-16)**.  
  * Second, a **20-inch Ball Valve (HV-18)**.  
  * **Bleed:** Between these two massive valves lies a **2-inch Drain Valve (HV-17)**.  
* **Barred Tee (Bar T):** The line from N9 connects to the main pipeline via a **Barred Tee**. This special tee fitting prevents the pig from accidentally entering the bypass line.  
* **Main Line Control:**  
  * Downstream of the Barred Tee on the main line is the Motor Operated Valve/Control Valve **EZV-01**.  
  * **Pig Signaler:** Between the Barred Tee and EZV-01, there is another Pig Signaler **(Z-01 / ZI-01)** to confirm the pig has passed or arrived.  
* **Final Output:**  
  * After passing EZV-01, the 20-inch line piping spec changes from **AP15L** to **GF07 AP15L**.  
  * The line continues toward the next scraper section.  
  * **Solenoid Taps:** Two final 2-inch connections are located here:  
    * **HV-19:** Connects to PI-02 (DCS) and PIT-02 (Field) pressure transmitters.  
    * **HV-20:** Connects to PZT-04 and PI-11.  
    * *Note:* The small bore piping for these instruments changes spec to **B 03 F9**.
